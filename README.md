<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://i.imgur.com/MnmM8w7.jpg)

This project is built to help users track their daily consumed food calories;which can be very helpful for diabetic and people who follow diatery.This web Application is built to help them store their daily foods and automatically calculate and summaries their calories intake.

What can this web app do:
* Let users enter their food types and the nutrient amount of protein,fat and carbohyderates contained in it , then it calculate the calories by applying the following formula : 
Calories=(Protein+Carb) x 4 + Fat x 9
* User can also update the previously entered food.
* User then can enter the date to track the consumed food , and add foods to this date.
* User then can see all the saved days , and he can delete it .

Here you are screenshots of the application depcting the web app functionality.

## Application design

<br/>

To design this simple MVP , I have designed the database to store user's data in 3 relations as show in the following picture.

![ER diagram](https://i.imgur.com/MnmM8w7.jpg)


<br/>

As shown in the design of the database the primary key is ID , which is autogenerated number, for relations log_date and food.The food date relation which store the the food aten in a day , have a composite primary key (log_date_id,food_id), which reference log_date.id and food.id respectively.
